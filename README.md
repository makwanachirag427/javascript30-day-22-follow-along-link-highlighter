# JavaScript30 Day 22 - Follow Along Link Highlighter

This repository contains the code and implementation for the JavaScript30 Day 22 project, titled "Follow Along Link Highlighter". This project focuses on creating an interactive and dynamic link highlighter that follows the mouse cursor.

## Project Description

In this project, we build a webpage that features a series of links. When the mouse hovers over a link, a highlight effect is triggered, creating a visually appealing experience for the user. The highlight effect smoothly follows the mouse cursor within the link, providing an engaging UI.

## Implementation

The implementation involves using HTML for the structure of the webpage and CSS for styling. The main focus, however, is on JavaScript, where event listeners are used to detect mouse movements and highlight the links accordingly.

The main steps of the implementation are as follows:
1. Create HTML structure for the links.
2. Style the links and the highlight effect using CSS.
3. Implement JavaScript to handle mouse movement and highlight the links accordingly.
